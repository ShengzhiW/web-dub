title:      "Leveraging a Human-Centered Approach to Machine Learning to Improve Youth Online Safety"

location:   "TBD"

abstract: |
  From detecting online harassment to the sexual predation of youth, the state-of-the-art
  computational risk detection approaches has the potential to protect particularly 
  vulnerable populations from online victimization. Overall, my research contributes to the 
  field of adolescent online safety and machine learning by taking a human-centered approach
  to truly understand the problem context and determine a meaningful ground truth of the 
  risky behaviors being detected through automated approaches. Starting by conducting a 
  systematic literature review of computational approaches for online sexual risk detection, 
  we found that most studies focused on detecting sexual grooming using datasets that are not
  reflective of the real-world interaction of users. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 
  adolescents’ posts and comments on an online peer support mental health forum to understand 
  how adolescents seek support about their online sexual interactions. Then, we designed and 
  implemented a data donation web tool for collecting social media data from teens to create 
  ecologically valid training datasets for risk detection machine learning applications. 
  Lastly, we developed human-centered machine learning models which can detect risky 
  conversations using this dataset so that timely interventions can be administered. Completing 
  a feature analysis, we found that contextual features and linguistic features contributed the 
  most to accurately detecting risky sexual conversations. In this talk, I will discuss why it 
  is crucial to train models using ecological valid datasets and consider victims' perspectives 
  of risks on such sensitive topics. I will also give an overview of my research projects and 
  will discuss more about the complexity and the sensitive nature of private datasets, and how 
  preserving the confidentiality and privacy of the participants is important. I plan to create 
  a research program that integrates how AI could be used for the social good of people for 
  mitigating online difficulties of vulnerable populations.

  Afsaneh Razi is an assistant professor at the Department of Information Science at Drexel 
  University’s College of Computing & Informatics (CCI). Her research expertise is positioned at 
  the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and machine learning (ML) to solve 
  sociotechnical issues. Her work strives to deeply understand societal issues and identify ways 
  to meditate these challenges using technology. Specifically, one of her active research areas 
  addresses the critical and timely problem of online safety by leveraging a multi-disciplinary 
  approach of human-centered machine learning to accurately detect risks vulnerable users encounter 
  online. She has a record of research publications from ACM’s premiere Conferences on Human Factors 
  in Computing Systems (CHI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), as well as the Conference 
  of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). She also has experience 
  working on fast-paced product projects using mix-methods in industry as a User Experience Researcher.
