title:      "Taking a Social Ecological Approach to Adolescent Online Safety"

location:   "TBD"

abstract: |
  Foster teens are some of the most vulnerable youth subject to serious online risks, such as sex
  trafficking. However, little research has studied how the internet plays a role in these risks, nor how we
  can develop effective interventions to empower foster youth against becoming victims. Therefore, my
  research, which is partially funded by the William T. Grant Foundation (a non-profit foundation that
  funds research with a focus on reducing inequality in youth outcomes), works to understand the social
  ecologies of support and contextual factors that play a role in how foster teens and other at-risk youth
  (ages 13-17) experience and engage in online environments. In this talk, I will discuss the challenges
  foster parents encounter trying to mediate their foster teensâ€™ technology use in the home, as well as
  heuristics for conducting risky research with teens. I believe adolescent online safety strategies should
  empower teens to manage their online experiences in a way that meaningfully benefits them. The goal
  of my research trajectory is to develop educational and technological interventions that can help
  promote more teen-centric approaches to online safety and reduce the digital inequalities experienced
  by teens in foster care.
