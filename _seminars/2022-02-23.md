title:      Designing for Critical Data Literacies

location:   "TBD"

abstract: |
  As everyone's lives and communities become increasingly data-mediated and data-driven, it is important for more voices to be heard in imagining and shaping how, when, and if data gets collected and used. How can we engage young people in experiences that enable them not only to learn about data practices but also to question and critique them? In this talk, I will engage with this question by drawing on the past ten years of my work in designing systems and experiences that support the fostering of critical data literacies. I will articulate design principles that I have developed through my work of developing systems and experiences for learning with and about data, describe their origins and applications, and conclude with an overview of some of my current projects on this topic.
  
  **Note: This talk will not be recorded.**
