title:      Artistic Brain-Computer Interfaces for the ADHD Community

location:   "TBD"

abstract: |
  Every year many students diagnosed with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity 
  Disorders (ADHD) join universities to pursue a college degree. Approximately 
  2% to 8% of college students with disabilities are diagnosed with ADHD. These 
  percentages are not considering the undiagnosed students, but with the disorder. 
  This disability in college campuses is also known to be one of the largest 
  increases seen in students as a hidden disability. The PI’s institution has 
  approximately 1500 students with disabilities and 342 of those students are 
  diagnosed with ADHD and this number keeps increasing. Typically, the course’s 
  curriculum expects these students to perform at the same level as those with a 
  high attention span. Lectures are not designed with students with attention 
  deficit in mind. Therefore, these students may spend more time studying outside 
  the classroom. However, while studying, they do not notice their attention drifts 
  away until several minutes later. Currently, there is no artistic 
  neurophysiological method to help students improve attention retention. In this 
  talk, I discuss how artistic Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) could help students 
  with ADHD improve their attention retention by creating abstract paintings with 
  their brains. Furthermore, I provide a quick introduction to BCIs and describe how 
  other BCIs methods can be adapted to help the ADHD community improve their 
  attention and affective/emotional state.

  Dr. Marvin Andujar (www.marvinandujar.com) is an Assistant Professor and Lab 
  Director of the Neuro-Machine Interaction research lab (www.neurosymbiosis.com) 
  in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of South 
  Florida, Tampa, FL. He received his Ph.D. in Human-Centered Computing from the 
  University of Florida. During his Ph.D. studies, Dr. Andujar was recognized as a 
  National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow, a GEM Fellow, a Generation's 
  Google Scholar, and an Intel Scholar. His research concentration is on Affective 
  Brain-Computer Interfaces where he focuses on measuring and decoding the user’s 
  affective state from the brain during human-machine interaction. His dissertation 
  work focused on measuring the effectiveness of quantified-self attention feedback 
  from the brain towards user’s attention improvement.
 
  Dr. Andujar is the researcher who started the Brain-Computer Interface initiative 
  in the department at his current institution. His effort has led to multiple 
  publications in journals and conferences, obtain external funding from the CEO of 
  Intel along with his colleagues, and co-founded the world’s first Brain-Drone Race. 
  His work has been showcased in more than 600 media outlets worldwide including US 
  News, New York Times, Associated Press, and Yahoo News, among others. Recently, he 
  has been named as one of the top 10 under 40 in Tampa Bay for his work and c
  ontribution to the community. Lastly, he is a member of ACM SIGCHI, IEEE Computers, 
  and the Brain-Computer Interface Society.
