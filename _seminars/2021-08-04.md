    title: "The Show Must Go On: A conceptual model of conducting synchronous participatory design with children online"
    publication: "CHI 2021"
#    video: 438743342
    abstract: |
      Co-designing with children in an online environment is increasingly important due to external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the diversification and inclusion of youth participants. Many prior studies about co-design with youth focus on co-located or asynchronous online sessions. However, conducting synchronous online co-design sessions adds layers of complexity and uncertainty to collaboration. This paper introduces a model explicating factors to consider when co-designing with children synchronously in an online space. We examined ten consecutive intergenerational participatory design sessions online where children (ages 7-11) and adults designed new technologies. Along with highlighting unexpected moments and interactions, we use theories of improvisation to guide our understanding of dynamic situations that are out of the control of researchers. This work contributes to improving theoretical understanding of improvisation as a method of inquiry for co-designing with youth, and offers practical suggestions for suitable online co-design techniques and implementation.

    title: "HulaMove: Using Commodity IMU for Waist Interaction"
    publication: "CHI 2021"
    video: 587526417
    abstract: |
      We present HulaMove, a novel interaction technique that leverages the movement of the waist as a new eyes-free and hands-free input method for both the physical world and the virtual world. We first conducted a user study (N=12) to understand users’ ability to control their waist. We found that users could easily discriminate eight shifting directions and two rotating orientations, and quickly confirm actions by returning to the original position (quick return). We developed a design space with eight gestures for waist interaction based on the results and implemented an IMU-based real-time system. Using a hierarchical machine learning model, our system could recognize waist gestures at an accuracy of 97.5%. Finally, we conducted a second user study (N=12) for usability testing in both real-world scenarios and virtual reality settings. Our usability study indicated that HulaMove significantly reduced interaction time by 41.8% compared to a touch screen method, and greatly improved users’ sense of presence in the virtual world. This novel technique provides an additional input method when users’ eyes or hands are busy, accelerates users’ daily operations, and augments their immersive experience in the virtual world.

  The DUB Shorts format focuses on sharing a research paper in a 15 to 20-minute talk,
  similar to traditional conference presentations of a paper.
  Speakers will first present the paper, then participate in Q&A.

  DUB shorts will be conducted using Zoom, via an invitation distributed to the DUB mailing list.
  Participants who are logged into Zoom using a UW account will be directly admitted,
  and participants who are not logged in to a UW account will be admitted using a Zoom waiting room.
