title:      "Robust Intelligence for Assistive Robots"

location:   "TBD"

abstract: |
  We would like for robots to be able to adaptively help people in their day-to-day 
  lives, but the state-of-the-art in robot learning is typically either 
  under-informed about the needs and abilities of actual users or is designed and 
  tested in highly-controlled environments and interactions that fail to reflect 
  real-world noise and complexity.  In our work, we focus on identifying the 
  real-world situations where current human-robot interaction (HRI) and robot 
  learning algorithms fail, and developing new methods that enable robots to 
  robustly learn to assist non-expert teachers under real-world noise and complexity.
  This includes using human-centered design to develop more realistic simulated 
  teachers for early algorithm development, incorporating both teacher and 
  environmental reward into state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning 
  algorithms, finding new ways to model and take advantage of rich-but-noisy 
  human feedback, and designing novel models that enable robot-robot collaboration 
  to improve detection of human attention.  Finally, throughout all of this work, 
  we seek to break down the artificial disciplinary divide between service robotics 
  for non-disabled users and assistive robotics for users with disabilities, and 
  ensure that our robots treat all users as valued partners who are integrated into 
  the social and physical environments in which they live their lives.

  This seminar is co-organized with [UW CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/).

bio: |
  Elaine Schaertl Short is the Clare Boothe Luce Assistant Professor of Computer 
  Science at Tufts University. She completed her PhD under the supervision of 
  Prof. Maja Matarić in the Department of Computer Science at the University of 
  Southern California (USC) in 2017. She received her MS in Computer Science from 
  USC in 2012 and her BS in Computer Science from Yale University in 2010. From 
  2017-2019 she worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Socially Intelligent 
  Machines Lab at the University of Texas at Austin.  At USC, she received 
  numerous awards for her contributions to research, teaching, and service, 
  including being one of very few PhD students to have received all three of the 
  CS department Best TA, Best RA, and Service awards.  

  Elaine’s research seeks to improve the computational foundations of human-robot 
  interaction by designing new algorithms that succeed in contexts where other 
  algorithms’ assumptions frequently fail, such as in child-robot interaction, 
  in minimally-supervised public space deployments, and in assistive interactions.   
  As a disabled faculty member, Elaine is particularly passionate about disability 
  rights in her service work.  In addition to having recently joined the new 
  AccessComputing Leadership Corps, she is the Communications Chair and Community 
  Liaison of AccessSIGCHI, an advocacy group that works to increase the 
  accessibility of the 24 SIGCHI conferences.
